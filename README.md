Interactive Java Dashboard for Air Quality Data

Dashboard has some issues and is still a work in progress.
It is planned to be an extension of an in-class project that further customizes the capabilities of the dashboard

Some fixes planned:
- Year text field filter does not currently work in conjunction with the site, only the quality
- try-catch block in the year text field should not be there as it is not explicit error checking
