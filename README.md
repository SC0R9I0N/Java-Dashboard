Interactive Java Dashboard for Air Quality Data from Allegheny County, PA

When using the code, you can comment the filenames and uncomment the one you want to use for the visualization. The FULL csv is the full dataset, but is not the most recent version of the dataset. Data is sourced from https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality 

Dashboard has some issues and is still a work in progress.
It is planned to be an extension of an in-class project that further customizes the capabilities of the dashboard

Some fixes planned:
- Year text field filter does not currently work in conjunction with the site, only the quality
- try-catch block in the year text field should not be there as it is not explicit error checking
